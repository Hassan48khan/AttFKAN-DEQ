# AttFKAN-DEQ

**Attention-Augmented Fourier Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks in Deep Equilibrium for Histopathological Breast Cancer Classification**

Official implementation of the paper (2025).

**Key Features**
- Fourier-based KAN layers for expressive multi-scale pattern capture
- Lightweight Convolutional Block Attention (LCBAM) for dynamic recalibration
- Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) framework with Anderson/Broyden solvers for memory-efficient infinite-depth processing
- Achieves 96.60% accuracy on BreakHis and 94.52% on IDC
- Outperforms ResNets, Transformers, ConvNeXt, and baseline DEQ-KAN
